### Shortcuts/Compromises made

If applicable. Did you do something that you feel could have been done better in a real-world application? Please let us know.

- Using create-react-app (deprecated!)
- Should have used Next.js

### Stretch goals attempted

If applicable, use this area to tell us what stretch goals you attempted. What went well? What do you wish you could have done better? If you didn't attempt any of the stretch goals, feel free to let us know why.

- Add tests: attempted
  - As mentioned above, I used create-react-app and then ejected from it to support the component/theming library I wished to use
  - As CRA is now deprecated, I believe the eject process installed outdated versions of npm packages, meaning the jest setup was not up-to-date
  - I struggled to get any tests to run, and even when I did
- Use TypeScript: succeeded (expand)
